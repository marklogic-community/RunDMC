        <h1>SuperNodes</h1>

        <p>As a means to better serve and understand its developer community, MarkLogic formed
        the SuperNodes group in summer 2011.  Members of this select group are among the most experienced and knowledgable 
        developers in our community.  The purposes of the program are

        <ul>
      <li>To provide a direct connection between MarkLogic and power-users in our community.</li>
      <li>To provide recognition and status to strong, active community members.</li>
    </ul>

        MarkLogic maintains a exclusive mailing list for SuperNode discussions.  On occasion, MarkLogic shares early preview "NDA-style" information with
            SuperNodes via this list.  Additional, benefits of membership include occasional discounts to MarkLogic events.
        </p>
